Chosen Component: Option 3
Rational: Though the motor for the product is embedded within a fan and chassis, this meetâ€™s the requirements of what the product wants to do. Though mounting is a bit limited, the specs allow us to operate the motor to the desired speed for its purpose. The only thing needed to test is the directional operation of the fan.

Chosen Component: Option 1
Rational:
When choosing which component to use, option 1 is the most reasonable choice. The component is well known and used in previous assignments. Included with this component are example diagrams of how to connect the component to both the controller and the motors and what commands are needed for operating the motor.
