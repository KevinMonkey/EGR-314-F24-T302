For our design ideation, each member started by creating ideas they thought would be cool for a project. However, this did not lead to very many results. After this initial session, we switched to a more systematic approach using a morphological chart and an enormous amount of possible solutions (65! / 11!12!11!1!7!8!16!). With such a plethora of options, our team decided to start getting specifc about what ideas we wanted to pursue

We judged, it primarily by our user needs and what we found as viable within our skill level and time deadliness.
