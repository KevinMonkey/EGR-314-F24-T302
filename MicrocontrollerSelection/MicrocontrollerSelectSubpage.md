Final Considerations:
Our team chose the PIC24F16KM204 (PIC 1) as our primary option due to its favorable operating voltage range of 1.8-3.6V, which aligns well with our device's power requirements. This microcontroller offers enhanced capabilities at a competitive price compared to other configurations within its family. The PIC24F16KM104 16-bit architecture provides increased processing speed and scalability for potential future upgrades, making it a good choice for our project. Additionally, the various low power settings available allow us to mitigate most concerns regarding power consumption, which would ensure efficient operation without sacrificing the overall performance of our device. While there are fewer packaging options, specifically a through hole version for testing and supporting resources, the overall advantages in capability, voltage compatibility, and power efficiency made the PIC 1 the best fit for our project's needs.
