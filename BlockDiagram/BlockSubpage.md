- Explain your decision making process for how you developed this and explain how your block diagram meets your product requirements

Our block diagram was created with the intent to get a overall view and understanding of how all the major hardware elements go together for our device. First we connected the actuator and sensing subsystems to our selected microcontroller. These were the wifi, temp, humidity  and motor driver-motor subsystems and assigned them to selected members in our team, indicating the necessary information like pin type, signal direction and pin assignments and others. Through our design process, we found that for our two 12C sensors, they needed to actually be on the same line. This was ok as long as the propper addresses to the sensors, critical to differential the devices on the line, are used. And we put it accordingly. Next was our device's necessary framework to get it to run sucessfully.This included power source type, device regulation, and necessary external programmers and assigned accordingly. Lastly was our minor peripherals, such as our button and debugging LEDs which were assigned to one member
