# Team 302 User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements 
Kyle Chin, Enrique Cervantes, Damien Damato, Rishik Atluri

 In the initial phase, our team conducted extensive research by analyzing user comments on various online platforms related to existing weather stations. By delving into forums, product reviews, and community discussions, we gained valuable insights into the experiences, preferences, and challenges users faced with current weather stations. These online user comments were systematically organized, and recurring themes were identified. This meticulous organization allowed us to distill common needs and concerns expressed by users.

The collected data was then meticulously organized by identifying common themes and patterns in the user feedback. Needs were categorized into distinct groups such as functionality, usability, durability, and connectivity. To ensure a targeted approach, the team prioritized these needs based on their perceived significance to users and alignment with the overarching project goals.
