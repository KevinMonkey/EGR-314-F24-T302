# Team 302 User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements 
Kyle Chin, Enrique Cervantes, Damien Damato, Rishik Atluri

 In the initial phase, our team conducted extensive research by analyzing user comments on various online platforms related to existing weather stations. By delving into forums, product reviews, and community discussions, we gained valuable insights into the experiences, preferences, and challenges users faced with current weather stations. These online user comments were systematically organized, and recurring themes were identified. This meticulous organization allowed us to distill common needs and concerns expressed by users.

The collected data was then meticulously organized by identifying common themes and patterns in the user feedback. Needs were categorized into distinct groups such as functionality, usability, durability, and connectivity. To ensure a targeted approach, the team prioritized these needs based on their perceived significance to users and alignment with the overarching project goals.

**Description:**
* OPTICAL NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGY: Take the guess work out of yard work. Our robot mower uses sensors and a wide angle, high dynamic range camera to identify grass even under extreme contrast lighting situations to allow the robot to navigate around your lawn efficiently.
* DESIGNED FOR SMALL LAWNS: Mow for up to 3 hours covering 1000 square feet while dropping small clippings on the lawn to feed the grass. For a larger yard, extra batteries can be purchased separately.
* OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE: Two ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles and automatically re-direct the robot mower to avoid obstacles as small as 6-inches
* NO GO FUNCTION: Use the included 33-feet of magnetic wires to create a virtual fence within your yard. Set up is easy with no power source or digging required and prevents the robot mower from entering any forbidden areas.
* CLIMB UP TO 35%(19°) SLOPE: Deep tread wheels and powerful drive system grips slopes to handle complex lawns
* DROP AND MOW: There is no need for an outdoor power socket or app setup. Simply set the robot mower on an appropriately sized lawn, push the start button, and let it get to work.
* FOR BEST RESULTS: A clearly defined edge around the full perimeter of your lawn is required to prevent the mower from leaving the grass. Adjustment of the lawn edges may be required. As with other robot mowers, a grass trimmer is needed to trim the lawn edges.
* INCLUDE: Robot mower, 1 x MX 24V MAX* battery, 24V quick battery charger, 33 ft magnetic strip, and 12pcs magnetic strip pegs, extra 3pcs blades

|“So here are my favorite features: 1. Great price in this category. 2. Effective at mowing. 3. Battery life is good; capable of doing at least the 1,000 sq ft that the mfr claims. 4. Super quiet [...].5 Kind of slow, but that's not a big deal since it runs on its own. Would I recommend it? YES. Especially for a hilly or uneven lawn that other robo mowers (like my much more expensive Segway) can't climb. The LawnMaster has a LOT of torque on its drive wheels, and climbs over pretty much anything it needs to. Got stuck when it went off-lawn and once when a drain cover caused the wheels to ride up off the ground. Otherwise, it's a monster for getting around. Cutting is pretty good, but of course limited by the semi-random travel pattern. It's a random pattern of straight lines across your lawn. It would have been nice to have a battery that charges IN the mower, vs. taking battery out of the mower, putting it in a charger, then replacing it in the mower when it's charged. But that's not the biggest deal, and it's made up for by the darn good price. I'd give this machine a try. I'm using it alongside a Segway, which has lots of bells and whistles but can't climb the portion of my lawn where I need more power on the drive wheels to get up the hill. No auto programming, no auto return, no mapping of the lawn to make an efficient set of passes over the grass. But it's under $500, so not much reason to skip it” |1. Cost Effective (Explicit) 2.

But, as soon as there was no more standing water in the low spots, I put this mower out there. Because of the size of the yard, I’m running it almost everyday.I cannot express to you how happy I am with this mower. No setup required, which was important to me. I just set it in the yard and turned it loose. It takes the hill like a champ. However, I did experiment in my front yard a little, and the hill there is a little steeper, and it tipped it over. So your hill has to be a nice gentle, not too steep, incline. Of course it works better when it’s dry because it will slip a little in the dew or after a light rain. It has no problem navigating my bumpy yard. I’ll never have to mow this massive yard again. Each battery lasts far longer than the 3 hours specified. I love this thing and won’t go without a robomower ever again. My wife named our Moweesha Mowmowa, and she’s quickly become a beloved family member.

|“This robotic mower is impressive! I have a small yard (about 12’ x 15’ with a 3’ x 5’ pathway) and was very glad to see how well it cut the grass. It cuts slow and I mainly have it set to cut in random directions. The back wheels are large and have deep treads. It is very quiet ~ barely audible unless you are near it. It had no difficulty sensing edges. It is absolutely amazing! I am disabled and needed something to help maintain the yard. This LawnMaster OcuMow has far exceeded my expectations! The video I uploaded is with it cutting on the lowest setting. It is amazing how even it cuts the grass! It drops the grass behind it as it cuts ~ the cut grass does not fly around everywhere like a hand-held grass trimmer or push mower.The OcuMow is very sturdy and well-built. It has a carry handle. The shipping box included everything stated in the listing. The included directions are simple and easy to understand.

|This unit operates great. Unlike other brands, this humidity probe does not just peg out in high humidities. I use it in the 85 to 98% humidity range and it seems to stay accurate throughout. Most of the other brands peg out at 99.9% And just stop working. This one really does the job well. Granted. It's a little bit more expensive than the others, but I think it's well worth it. If you're trying to control temperature and high humidity, this is the one to get. I only wish they had the option to get the temperature probe that comes with the 308s which is waterproof. | 1.

|The product received was exactly as described. Great product with quite a few options for settings. The high/low alarms are great and can be set to over a 25 degree difference. I purchased to regulate temp and humidity in frog vivarium. They are doing well thanks to this controller I can sleep at night and know the frogs are in prime conditions. Also purchased a zoo med temp and humidity gauge for cheap to check accuracy and both are spot on. Good product I can trust! Directions are a little confusing but after messing around with it for a hour and testing it's really easy. | 1. Great customer satisfaction with the product(explicit) 2.

|The inkbird ITC-608T Temperature and Humidity controller makes a wonderful addition in my home garden arena. I live in Ohio and constantly battle with climate control in my indoor garden, and this controller has been amazing. The contoller is so simple to use and to operate. Me having zero know-how about temp controllers, found that this was super simple to set up and start working right away. The controller probs are accurate I have 3 other thermometers to check the accuracy for the Temp and Humidity. Setting the temp and humitity was super easy and readjusting is just a click of a few buttons. I would recommend this controller for anyone looking to control the indoor environment for their plants. Look no more this is your solution to your problems. | 1. Easy to operate and set up (latent) 2. Very Accurate device (latent) 3. Able to change the controller settings(latent)|

|Have you got any suggestions for improvement? Yes, I do. Rewrite the description so it is more understandable. I was led to believe by the description it would control the following functions. Heat, cool, humidify, dehumidify. There are only 2 electric outlets on the controller. I thought Inkbird had come up with some sort of way to piggyback the other functions which is not the case. It will run any 2 functions but not 4 as the literature leads you to believe. I have not tried the humidity control and will not since humidity is more critical to mushrooms than temp. If it is as inaccurate as the temp portion of the controller, it would either cause it to rain or dry out the inside of the grow chamber. Both of which would cause the loss of 2-3 months of work. | 1. Product description is not clear(latent) 2. Missing other functionalities(explicit) 3.

Product stop working after short amount of use(explicit) 2. Unable to contact customer support(explicit) 3. Two devices fail after only 2 months of use(explicit)|
|Very accurate and reliable, but being unable to turn off the alarm is stupid. Using it in mushroom cultivation and do not need to be alarmed when humidity reaches 99% no matter what! There are other makes that are less expensive and aren’t nearly as poorly designed for mushrooms. The manufacturer stated that this is to ensure the sensor is no submerged, but growing conditions can easily reach 99% without submerging the sensor or damaging it. | 1. Unable to disable alarm(latent) 2. Poorly design to grow mushrooms(latent) 3. Senors susceptible to high humidity(latent)|

|I use TagPlus-TH to measure the temperature in transit. This is a user-configurable temperature and humidity recorder.The configuration software is FDA approved. I care about this so that I can use it safely. I set a 30 minutes start delay with the software to avoid inaccurate temperature readings when starting transportation. The screen displays information include the Max and Min both temperature and humidity. This gives me intuitive view of the current temperature and humidity. It can be marked by pressing button. It's very easy to use. The logger can record the temperature and humidity for 90 days when it set 5 minutes interval, which is enough to make long transport.I haven't found other problems so far.

|Excellent device with excellent software! I don't know why another reviewer said they had to download a virus. I have both Avast and Malwarebytes Pro and neither detected anything. The software is super nice and gives you any option you could want including automatic MKT (mean kinetic temperature) calculation which is awesome if you're using this to monitor shelf life or perform an accelerated aging study. I used this to monitor refrigerated storage and set alarms at 32 F and 38 F, which are noted on the graph as red limit lines. It's very easy to see where temperature excursions occurred. The software can output data as a PDF, CSV Excel file, or a PNG. Even if you don't work with pharmaceuticals, deliveries, or product testing, you can use this to monitor your home heating, cooling, or humidity systems (with the humidity model).

|I am a HVACR tech and use data loggers to confirm system's stability, correct and sufficient defrost cycles and to help with troubleshooting of intermittent issues. This logger has enough memory to log both temperature and humidity for 24 days at 1 minute interval. Starting a logging event can be done from the buttons on the front as long as the device is already set up, and it has a built in start time delay to prevent false readings as the logger is moved into a space and the readings stabilize. It is easy to set up with the downloaded software on a computer, but the data log can be read with any device that can read a PDF file on a USB memory device (I have used both an Android phone with a USB adaptor and a Chromebook to read the information so far).

|A couple of months ago I got one of these: "Tzone Digital USB Temperature Data Logger" via the Vine program and liked it so much that I bought a second one. Price at that time was $20. Subsequently, this logger became available so I ordered it as well. Listed price was $30. Both logger models appear to be designed to travel with temperature-sensitive cargo like drugs or food. The more expensive logger comes with a calibration certificate from a Chinese lab claiming traceability to USA-NIST.The main functional difference between the two is that the more expensive logger has a better display, showing current humidity and temp, run status, etc. Both models automatically provide PDF and CSV files of the most recent log when they are plugged into my computer. Thus no need to run the provided software to just review the data. I found the setup and control software for the cheaper units easier to use and to understand.

|The setup process was straightforward, and the sensors have been generally reliable. While they can be a bit slow to update at times, the overall performance is satisfactory. The ability to check the readings remotely via the app gives me peace of mind, especially for the garage and attic, where temperature fluctuations can be more significant.So, we really like the sensors. They are connected over our home network, so I can check them anywhere, anytime. The Govee app is nice and easy to use, and it's easy to add the devices. I did get one bum battery that died in the first week, but that inconsequential. The others are running strong. And they work fine with our Eneloop rechargeables.Small, precise, and wireless.

|They seem relatively accurate compared to others weather stations inside and outside the house and compared to the officially reported temps. I calibrated them all in the same room before placing them in their final positions.Getting them connected to WiFi wasn't all that straightforward, and it took me a bit of time. Once I got one done the others were all easy though. Another reviewer here detailed something they did that made it work and I followed their lead. I can't remember what it was. I did not find the installation guidance of the app all that clear nor the app itself all that intuitive. There's a lot going on in that app that seems confusing and unnecessary to me, but that may be because they have so many devices available to buy and use on a hub - I'm not sure.At any rate, in spite of my hiccups with it, I'd recommend it. Just know you might hit snags with installation and search the reviews here for some tips. Also know you'll be going through batteries and put them in places easy to reach for ease of changing them out. | 1. Accurate readings and displays 2. Portable 3. Small and easy to place|

|When I set these up, I noticed that I was getting readings that varied by 1-2 degrees F between sensors that were nearly side by side. I then bought a thermometer with an NIST certificate to measure against these devices. This more or less confirmed that they are accurate within typically +/- 1 degree F. For what I need it for, I decided that this was acceptable so I continued using the sensors.BUT......after about 2-3 months of using these sensors and gateways I started to notice that monitoring the snake enclosures remotely was becoming less reliable despite no changes in my home wifi network. Since I travel a lot for work, remote monitoring is considered essential for me and a large reason I bought this set-up. More and more frequently, when I tried to update the sensors remotely the wifi would not update through the gateway.THEN, I started to notice some of the sensors would not update despite the wifi gateway updating the other sensors (I'm using around 12-14 sensors). The battery would indicate full yet the sensors were not updating. Changing the battery would only fix the problem about half of the time. Deleting the device from the app and reinstalling it would fix it about half of the time. The problem though is that some of these sensors would just completely stop being found by bluetooth when you try to reinstall them. | 1. Wifi communication errors 2. Battery measurement errors 3. App communication errors|
|Bought this to monitor freezer temperatures remotely via smartphone alerts. Was able to get everything set up without much trouble, but ran into a couple major downsides. One, the product does not support connecting/alerting via anything except their own app. Want to connect to your Smarthome or google home app? Tough luck, one more app you are forced into installing instead of being able to consolidate. Every other smart product I've purchased has supported connecting to the Tuya smart life app, so it was a blow that this one didn't. Second, and more importantly, the alert function in the app is soft locked at a low of -4 F, which means if the temperature ever drops below that you will ALWAYS be alerted. This is a major issue for anyone who wants to use it for freezer monitoring - there is so much alert spam because of this I probably won't notice when a genuine alert comes in. I understand that the product is not officially rated for under -4 but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to turn off alerts when it goes under. Product is almost unusable because of this extremely poor app design issue which they could easily fix. | 1. No app to app communication outside of the company program 2. Error in setting temperature parameters. 3. Spamming of alerts.|
|Despite overly cumbersome mobile phone app, things started okay. The gateway device connected to my phone via Bluetooth and I finally got it to connect to Wi-Fi. The app displayed a request for a firmware upgrade which I accepted. After the upgrade was done, the gateway would no longer connect to Wi-Fi or even to my phone via Bluetooth. So that is what tech support is for, right? Govee tech support started out with the usual: reboot the phone, reinstall the app, try detecting gateway from scratch. Dutifully tried those things. No success. Then they asked for a picture of it NOT working (trying to prove a negative?). That isn't tech support; more like a delaying tactic. Feel like other reviewer: «technical support tried to obfuscate me until the return period expired, offering no meaningful assistance». | 1. Gateway between phone and bluetooth has errors 2. Requires a secondary device for communication 3. If the device does not work, it is impossible to communicate without it.|

|This is my third AcuRite station I've bought over the past 10 years, only because of weather-related issues with the outside units. My last one two weeks ago was struck by baseball-sized hail that broke off one of my wind scoops. Luckily, even with the new outside unit, my other previous inside monitors still pick it up, so now I have three monitors of all sorts in my house. I do like the color monitor with this new unit. I'm not sure why people say they can't read theirs from different angles because I plugged mine in and can read it perfectly from all angles. It also looks good and is easier to read when the room is dark.| 1. Weather station durability 2. Colour display preference 3. Variable display angle visibility |
|Had a minimal sensor AcuRite and placed the outside sensor in the shade but weather is such a big thing in Tucson I added an upgrade and the sensor is in the sun with a wind speed. Set up was EASY and put both on channel C added batteries and it worked . Using to compare to the other the inside is very close and the in sun temps is up a few degrees. I LOVE the black background- the other lite up the roommate night but that's OK both are cool the combo is priced right, good quality and accurate so far-plus easy to set up | 1. Weather station placement flexibility 2. Ease of setup 3. Affordability|
|I had other weather stations that only showed the dew point until you reached certain temps, then it switched to heat index or wind chill, this one will show it all the time if you want. I love the extra features over some others I've had before like seeing not only the day high and low, but also the months high/low and all time high/low. I had a receiver for an older model Acurite 3 in 1, and it works off of the sensor as well, so anyone who is wondering if you can use more than one receiver for this, it's possible. Now I keep my older one upstairs in my bedroom and this main one in the kitchen. The screen is very bright with adjustable brightness, very easy to read. | 1. Adjustable brightness for display 2. Compatibility with older models 3. Comprehensive historical data|

|Already broken | Durable|
|The display readability is poor, requiring a very specific viewing angle for things to appear The buttons on this are terrible, (loose, occasionally unresponsive, just cheap in general)Accuracy: Didn't experience any. With both units within 3 feet of each other, I received the following readingTemperature: Indoor = 188 F, Outdoor = 75 F (within 30 minutes, Indoor reading was 32 F)Humidity: Indoor = 88%, Outdoor = 41% (within 30 minutes indoor reading was blank)Time: Time and date were set, but within 20 minutes, the time was slow by 7 minutesI went through the calibration procedure, but it would not allow calibration of the indoor sensors, and routinely failed to advance from measure to measure with button presses. In general, the behavior seemed like there were firmware bugs or poor connections.I'd say quality control and construction materials should be reviewed. | 1. Display readability 2. Accuracy of reading 3. Button quality and responsiviness|
|Not very good. Wind speed sensor reads low. The weather forecasting feature is wrong more often than not. The display is too bright and the history is annoying as it continually flips from one sensor to another. If I could return this I would but have had for over a month so can't. | 1. Accurate wind speed sensor 2. Return policy|

# Jamboard/Sticky Notes:
To assign appropriate ranks to each need, our team employed an approach that prioritizes needs which surfaced more frequently in user interviews and were assigned higher ranks. For instance, if product reliability was a common concern mentioned by 80% of users, it received a correspondingly higher weight. Additionally, qualitative data was considered to fine-tune these weights. If a particular need was strongly emphasized by users, it was granted a higher weight, even if it wasn't the most frequently mentioned.Our team decided to rank the ideas into two categories: passive and active ranking depending on the functionalities of the ideas.
